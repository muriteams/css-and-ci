> Essentially there are 3 types of variables: 1) individual variables that are participant demographics, and their scores on the personality and emotional/social intelligence measures; 2) relational variables (self-reported relationships among participants in the same team), and 3) team performance scores ('collective intelligence/CI' scores, and scores on the specific tests used to compute CI). 
-All data files (SPSS format) and codebooks are in this dropbox file: MURI USC\Data\Final data set
-The individual-level data set (each row is our n=178 participants) is "MURI_AllSurveys - FINAL_073018.sav"
-The group-level data set (each row is a group, n=42) is "MURI_AllSurveys - FINAL - Group level data_1"
Jen made a codebook for the group-level data set: "Group-level dataset Codebook 6-5-17.xls" 
The description of the variables/coding frame for the individual data set is in SPSS. I'm not sure how to export this. I could fiddle with this in SPSS next week to try and work it out if you can't access it. 
There are a lot of individual variables assessing personality/social intelligence, that we've distilled to the following key constructs (which I think were clearly outline in the summary of the "profiles analysis" word doc that I emailed you):
RME : this is the 'reading in the mind in the eyes' test score that represents social perceptiveness
SI3Fac1:  factor score for 1st factor that represents "socially accommodating" 
SI3Fac2:  factor score for 2nd factor that represents  "socially gregarious" 
SI3Fac3: factor score for 3rd factor that represents "socially aware"
